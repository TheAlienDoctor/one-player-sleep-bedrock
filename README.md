# One player sleep for Minecraft Bedrock edition
The aim of this pack is to create a one player sleep for Bedrock edition, but unlike most other one player sleeps doesn't change the behaviour of sleeping (e.g. speeding up how long you stay in a bed or having to be on top of the bed for one player sleep to work). Instead, this pack simply works and is a great alternative for the playersleepingpercentage gamerule that is not yet in Bedrock edition.

As well as this, you can optionally use the resource pack to turn certain texts in the game to make it clearer only one player has to sleep (see below in the features)

### Features
- Only one player will have to sleep to skip the night and change the weather to clear
- What makes this pack uniquid is that this pack doesnt change any other vanilla aspects of sleeping, for example it takes the same amount of time to sleep (unlike other packs)
- If you are using it with the resource pack then it will also change the vanilla text to say "x/1 players sleeping" and shorten the message in chat that says about every player needing to sleep to skip to day
